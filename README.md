The aim of this project is to create a social media application for Android that replicates many of the features seen in modern apps today (specifically Twitter).

I've chosen to create the app layout using XML because I'm more familiar with how to use it. I plan on transitioning the app to Jetpack Compose once I become more comfortable working with it.

## Features Implemented

- Login functionality
- Create account
- Home screen
- Profile screen (change profile picture, change username etc.)

## Working on

- Ability to send tweets
- Ability to like tweets and follow users
- Display of tweets on home screen
