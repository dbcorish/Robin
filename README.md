The aim of this project is to create a social media application for Android that replicates many of the features seen in modern apps today (specifically Twitter).

I've chosen to create the app layout using XML because I'm more familiar with how to use it. I plan on transitioning the app to Jetpack Compose once I become comfortable working in it.

## Features Implemented

- Login functionality
- Create account
- Home screen

## Working on

- Profile screen (change profile picture, change username etc.)
- Ability to send tweets
- Ability to like and follow users
- Display of tweets on home screen
